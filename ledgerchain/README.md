# Ledgerchain smart contract

Ledgerchain is a decentralized proof-of-ownership registry for NFTs, real estate, or physical assets built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Description

Ledgerchain allows users to register their assets by minting unique NFTs as proof of ownership. The system facilitates secure transfer or sale of assets through signature verification from both parties. It also includes optional integration with Bitcoin for payments or collateralization.

## Smart Contract Features

- Asset registration (minting NFTs)
- Asset ownership transfer with signature verification
- Asset details storage and retrieval
- Asset price updates
- Asset purchase using Bitcoin (placeholder implementation)

## Usage

### Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with the contract using the Stacks API or a frontend application. Here are some example function calls:

1. Register an asset:
   ```
   (contract-call? .ledgerchain register-asset "Mona Lisa Painting" u1000000)
   ```

2. Transfer an asset:
   ```
   (contract-call? .ledgerchain transfer-asset u1 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM (signature))
   ```

3. Get asset details:
   ```
   (contract-call? .ledgerchain get-asset-details u1)
   ```

4. Update asset price:
   ```
   (contract-call? .ledgerchain update-asset-price u1 u1100000)
   ```

5. Buy an asset using Bitcoin:
   ```
   (contract-call? .ledgerchain buy-asset u1 0x...)
   ```

## Security Considerations

- The current implementation uses a simplified signature verification process. In a production environment, a more robust verification system should be implemented.
- The Bitcoin integration is currently a placeholder. A proper integration would require additional off-chain components and potentially the use of oracles.
- Always audit smart contracts thoroughly before deploying to mainnet.
